          My first encounter with programming is when I learned <b>Python</b> out of curiosity when I was in Senior High
          School. Coding was not included as a subject in our Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
          curriculum but technology has always been fascinating to me.

          I fell in love with automation and scripting. I like the idea of using computers to make my life easier.
          Programming became quite addictive because of the immediate feedback it gives me when solving problems.
          Programming taught me to be an efficient and creative thinker. My journey to this rewarding pursuit began when
          I entered college.

          I got into different hobbies involving programming. I used to develop plugins for a custom Minecraft server
          where I and my friends used to play. I was immersed into the wonderful community of Linux and Free and Open
          Source Software (FOSS).

          Everyday, I try to live by the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing at a time, and doing it well. I'm currently
          learning the ReactJS Framework for building web applications, although I am looking to explore my options in
          the following domains: <i>Internet of Things (IoT), Web, Cloud Computing, Data Science and Cybersecurity</i>.
